# Task 1
1) Dictionary:
  - Creating a Dictionary and Running basic Algorithms like Finding length, Data types, Adding different data types Like Integer, Float, boolean, String, etc.
2) LIst :
  - Creating list and running a basic algorithm. Modifying elements
  	Using .append() and .insert() to add the elements
  	Removing Elements using .remove(), pop(), clear()
  	List is a mutable dataset so we can be done sorting, reverse, extend, copy
3) Operators :
  - Operators in Python
	     1. Arithmetic ( + , - , / , *, ** )
	     2. Comparative ( == , != , < , > ,<= ,>=)
	     3. Logical ( and , or )
	     4.Assignment ( -=, += , *=)
	     5. Identy ( is(==) , is not(!=))
	     6. Membership ( in , not in)
4) Common Errors in Python:
  - Discussion some basic pthon errors:
  		ZeroDivisionError
		Name Error
		Value Error
		Index error
		Type error
		Identeation Error
		Key error
5) Set :
- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- holds some discussion on data types and Fuctions related to  the Set
6) Tuple :
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
  
7) Numbers :
- There mainly 3 types in Python

	1.Integers
	    Def: Whole Number without a fractional or decimal point. They can be Positive or may be Negative or zero. Ex. 77, -58,0, etc
	    
	2.Floats
	    Def: Numbers that contain a decimal point or are expressed in scintific notation 
	    Ex. 2.3,00.15.-0.2545
	3. Complex Number
	    Def : Number in the form of a+bj where a is real part and the b is imaginary part


# Task 2:
1) For Loop:
- for loop is used for do iterstion overe a specific sequence

2) If else :
- if else is condiation al satetment that allows user to set the a condition for iteartion.
This contain two part of code 1 st one is 'if' and 2nd is 'else'.
If the first condition Is False then iteration forwarded two else condition.

3) Exapmle :
- Given a list, write a Python code to swap first and last element of the list.

write code count lenght of string

Write a Python program to get the sum of a only non-negative integer. ex, [1,4,-5,-20,10] ans is 15
write code of factorial , ex.ans 6 (321)


4) While loop :
- In While loop, iteration done upto unknown limitaion with condition for stoping the itearation. We dont perfectly where the iteration can be done.
- #1)odd-even using while loop 
- 2) using while

- 3) creat list 1-20 numbers list using while loop=> [1,2,3... 20]
- 4)  creat list 20-1 (revers order) using while loop=> [20,19...1]
- 5) try with one any eg. break, contnue , pass control statement
